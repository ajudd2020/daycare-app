# Read the README

This is not a portfolio site. This is not a completed site. This is a work in progress that will end up including many of the languages/ frameworks/ technologies I am familiar with (although not all).

Why no portfolio? Well, because the one I have is pre bootcamp days. While I was proud of it when I made it, I'm even more proud to say that my skills have advanced significantly since I coded that simple, vanilla JavaScript, single page, no backend, site. I have wanted to make another portfolio, but this seemed like a better idea for the moment.

The point of this project is to have fun, try out my skills in a solo development environment, and to keep up to date with changes to exisiting libraries I use reguluarly (for example, Redux including a new Toolkit and MaterialUI moving to MUI)

## Languages/ Frameworks Used

- JavaScript
- React
- Redux
- React Router
- NodeJS
- Express
- PostgreSQL
- Sequelize
- MUI

## Future Plans

In the future, I hope to containerize this app using Docker, and deploy it using AWS. I would like to move the database to RDS, as well as use ECS and EC2 to deploy my Docker images. I plan to do all of this using CloudFormation.

After getting the basics deployed in the cloud, I hope to continue exploring AWS services to see what I can incorporate into this project.

## Other langauges/ technologies I'm familiar with not included in this project:

- AWS - Lambda, DynamoDb, State/Step Machines, CloudWatch, API Gateway, EventBridge, SNS
- Python - basic scripting
- PHP/ Drupal
